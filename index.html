	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>
	    <font size="4"> 

		        I hold a Master’s degree in ASEAN Studies from the University of Malaya (QS ranking 60), where I graduated with distinction (GPA 3.89/4).
		    My studies, supervised by <a href="https://umexpert.um.edu.my/fumitaka.html" target="_blank">Professor Fumitaka Furuoka</a> , focused on Southeast Asian regionalism, political economy, and security,
		    and I developed strong qualitative research skills through coursework such as ASEAN and Economic Integration, The Making of
		    Modern Southeast Asia, and Political Economy of Asia-Europe Relations.

                    <br><br>My academic journey is deeply shaped by my cross-cultural and interdisciplinary experiences. 
		    I come from China and have lived and studied in Malaysia, while also conducting research on China’s 
		    foreign aid in Cambodia. My master’s thesis explored the moral dimensions of China’s Belt and Road 
		    Initiative projects through qualitative interviews, which sharpened my interest in how ethics and power
		    intersect in international development and technological systems.
		    
		    <br><br>In addition to my studies, I’ve worked in international education organizations, where I managed 
		    collaborative programs and educational projects between Chinese and foreign institutions. This has given 
		    me first-hand experience navigating multilingual environments and coordinating across cultural boundaries—skills 
		    I now bring into my research practice.
		    
		    <br><br>As artificial intelligence and robotic technologies become increasingly embedded in 
		    everyday life—not only in industry or healthcare, but also in homes and intimate spaces—I have 
		    become deeply curious about how these innovations are reshaping our social world. My academic background 
		    in Southeast Asian studies, paired with my interest in ethics and human relationships, naturally led me 
		    to question how technologies like domestic robots might influence care work, gender roles, and emotional 
		    labor within families. This shift in focus grew organically from my previous research on moral responsibility 
		    and foreign aid, as I began to see parallels in how power, design, and values are embedded in both development 
		    projects and intelligent machines.
		        
		    
		    <br><br>These experiences have prepared me to explore how emerging technologies like domestic robots
		    affect everyday life, especially in terms of social relationships, care, and responsibility.
		    I am excited to apply design ethnography and feminist perspectives to better understand the lived 
		    experiences and social impacts of human–robot interaction in the home.

                <b>   Attribute Graph Clustering Driven Cell Map of Single Cell Spatial Transcriptome</b>
		</a>
		      <br> First author, under reviewing

			<br>
			<br>With the development of precision and speed of spatial transcriptomics (ST) in sequencing, 
				it is becoming more and more important to use the unique characteristics of ST data for cell 
				analysis. Here, we introduce STAGC, which is a graph self-encoder method developed based on the clustering 
				of ST data. In view of the problem that traditional graph clustering algorithms are task-oriented rather than
				clustering, STAGC monitors the clustering process of self-training graphs by introducing soft labels generated
				from graph embedding itself, which can iteratively refine the clustering results. In addition, unlike the existing
				methods that directly construct graphs by calculating Euclidean distance between cell coordinates, STAGC constructs
				graphs that are more conducive to clustering task objectives by finding cells with similar gene expression patterns 
				within the threshold specified by the results of Euclidean distance.
			<br><br>
				In addition, we try to use different methods to explore the tumor microenvironment with single cell resolution. 
				This will be based on the transcriptome data of the surrounding cells of each cell (excluding this cell) for fusion and cluster analysis. 
				Comparing the results with the traditional pca method or gnn method, we find that different operation methods will bring different interesting 
				results. For example, the potential comparative experiments include: whether to carry out pca and its parameters, the way to fuse the data 
				of surrounding cells, whether to use gnn, the number of surrounding cells selected, and is it possible to define the central cell only by the surrounding cells
